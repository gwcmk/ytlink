ytlink
======

A project to improve YouTube links on music blogs. Sometimes, it may be preferable to discreetly play the video on the
same page as the article. Links to YouTube may be provided simply for context, so leaving the page to watch the video
may not be necessary.

This project is still a work in progress, do not use it as-is on any blog or website.

####TODO List
- [x] "sticky" video player
- [x] add support for timestamps in URL
- [ ] does not behave correctly on "overscrolling" the bottom of the page
- [ ] improve performance
- [ ] eliminate "jitter" on scroll
