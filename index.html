      Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations.

      Fuck. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. You are not your fucking work. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think.

      When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, &ldquo;When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.&rdquo; Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. This design is fucking brilliant.

      Design is all about fucking relationships&mdash;the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship  of designer and user. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Someday is not a fucking day of the week.

      While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, &ldquo;When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.&rdquo; Learn from fucking criticism. Paul Rand once said, &ldquo;The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.&rdquo; Don’t worry about what other people fucking think.

      Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Respect your fucking craft. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Someday is not a fucking day of the week.

      Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Paul Rand once said, &ldquo;The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.&rdquo; Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Use your fucking hands. Must-do is a good fucking master. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Fuck.

      Don’t fucking lie to yourself. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. You are not your fucking work. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself.

      Don’t fucking lie to yourself.  Form follows fucking function. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Respect your fucking craft. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what.

      Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Intuition is fucking important. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly.
